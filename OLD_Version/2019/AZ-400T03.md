## Course AZ-400T03-A: Implementing Continuous Delivery


### About this course
This course provides the knowledge and skills to implement continuous delivery. Students will learn how to design a release strategy, set up a release management workflow, and implement an appropriate deployment pattern.

<br/> 

### Audience profile
Students in this course are interested in implementing DevOps processes or in passing the Microsoft Azure DevOps Solutions certification exam

<br/> 

### After completing this course, students will be able to:
 * Differentiate between a release and a deployment
 * Define the components of a release pipeline
 * Explain things to consider when designing your release strategy
 * Classify a release versus a release process, and outline how to control the quality of both
 * Describe the principle of release gates and how to deal with release notes and documentation
 * Explain deployment patterns, both in the traditional sense and in the modern sense
 * Choose a release management tool
 * Explain the terminology used in Azure DevOps and other Release Management Tooling
 * Describe what a Build and Release task is, what it can do, and some available deployment tasks 
 * Classify an Agent, Agent Queue and Agent Pool
 * Explain why you sometimes need multiple release jobs in one release pipeline
 * Differentiate between multi-agent and multi-configuration release job
 * Use release variables and stage variables in your release pipeline
 * Deploy to an environment securely, using a service connection
 * Embed testing in the pipeline
 * List the different ways to inspect the health of your pipeline and release by using, alerts, service hooks and reports
 * Create a release gate
 * Describe deployment patterns
 * Implement Blue Green Deployment
 * Implement Canary Release
 * Implement Progressive Exposure Deployment
 
 <br/> 
 
### Prerequisites
 * Fundamental knowledge about Azure, version control, Agile software development, and core software development principles.
 * It would be helpful to have experience in an organization that delivers software.
