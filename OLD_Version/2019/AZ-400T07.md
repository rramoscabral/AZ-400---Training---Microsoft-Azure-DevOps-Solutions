## Course AZ-400T07-A: Designing a DevOps Strategy

### About this course
This course provides the knowledge and skills to design a DevOps strategy.  
Students will learn how to plan for transformation, select a project, and create team structures. Students will also learn how to develop quality and security strategies.  
Planning for migrating and consolidating artifacts and source control will also be covered.
<br/> 

### Audience profile
Students in this course are interested in planning DevOps projects or in passing the Microsoft Azure DevOps Solutions certification exam.

### After completing this course, students will be able to:
* Plan for the transformation with shared goals and timelines.
* Select a project and identify project metrics and KPIs.
* Create a team and agile organizational structure.
* Develop a project quality strategy.
* Plan for secure development practices and compliance rules.
* Migrate and consolidate artifacts.
* Migrate and integrate source control measures.

### Prerequisites
* Fundamental knowledge about Azure, version control, Agile software development, and core software development principles. It would be helpful to have experience in an organization that delivers software.
* Also, it is recommended that you have experience working in an IDE, as well as some knowledge of the Azure portal. However, students who may not have a technical background in these technologies, but who are curious about DevOps practices as a culture shift, should be able to follow the procedural and expository explanations of continuous integration regardless.
