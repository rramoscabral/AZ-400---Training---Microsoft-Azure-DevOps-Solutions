**5. Enable Online lab host** 

Labs are run through an Authorized Lab Hosters(ALHs) for Microsoft Official Curriculum.

The trainee does not choose which lab hoster he wants to use, this decision is made by the training center.

Testing the Lab hoster Environment
* [go deploy](https://lms.godeploy.it/DemoLabs/Register)
* [Skillable](https://www.skillable.com/demo-request/)
    * [Lab Orientation & Connectivity Check](https://labondemand.com/Launch/122B02AA)
* [Xtremelabs](https://xtremelabs.io/xtremelabs-products/testing/)
    * [Lab with multiple vms](https://labs.xtremelabs.io/ondemandconnection/launchlabbyalias?alias=demo-01)
    * [Lab with steps and self assessments](https://labs.xtremeconsulting.com/ondemandconnection/launchlabbyalias?alias=demo-02)

Troubleshooting
* Use Edge, Chrome, Firefox, or another HTML5 compliant browser
* Ensure you aren't connected to a VPN at the same time
* If you are on a corporate network, make sure your IT department doesn't have any firewall rules that would block access
    * [go deploy][https://docs.godeploy.it/general/connectivity-requirements]
    * [Skilable](https://docs.learnondemandsystems.com/tms/connectivity-requires.md)
    * [XtremeLabs](https://moc.microsoftlabsonline.com/content/skins/moc/self-servicestudentguidetomlos.pdf)
* If there is an issue with your local network configuration, a simple reboot may resolve it
* Lab host service status and active incident
    * [go deploy](https://status.skillable.com/)
    * [Skilable](https://status.skillable.com/)
    * [XtremeLabs](http://status.xtremelabs.io/)
* Testing Internet Connectivity
    * A [http://www.speedtest.net/](http://www.speedtest.net/) test should be carried out by selecting London or New York. 
    * Ensure there is a latency of less than 200ms. 
    * A latency of less than 150ms will give the best lab experience.

<br/>

**Can I use my own device?**
* Yes, you just have to prepare your machine with all the necessary software. See the list of required software.
* However, it has the disadvantage that the instructor cannot help you directly. The Lab host provides functionality where the instructor directly interacts with your lab environment.

**7. Enable Parallel jobs using Azure Subscription**

This is necessary to enable parallel jobs and this change will take **3 hours**.

1. Open a browser and navigate to (Azure DevOps)[https://aex.dev.azure.com/me]
1. Click **Organization settings** in the bottom left corner.
1. At the **Organization settings** screen click **Billing** (opening this screen takes a few seconds).
1. Click **Setup billing** and on the right-hand side of the screen select the Azure subscription and click **Save** to link the subscription with the organization.
1. Once the screen shows the linked Azure Subscription ID at the top, change the number of **Paid parallel jobs** for **MS Hosted CI/CD** from 0 to **1**. Then click the **SAVE** button at the bottom. 
1. In **Organization Settings**, go to section **Security** and click **Policies**.
1. Toggle the switch to **On** for **Third-party application access via OAuth**
    > Note: The OAuth setting helps enable tools such as the DemoDevOpsGenerator to register extensions. Without this, several labs may fail due to a lack of the required extensions.
1. Toggle the switch to **On** for **Allow public projects**
    > Note: Extensions used in some labs might require a public project to allow using the free version.
1. **Wait at least 3 hours before using the CI/CD capabilities** so that the new settings are reflected in the backend. Otherwise, you will still see the message *"No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted"*.
1. OPTIONAL: you can validate these new settings have been successfully applied by creating and triggering a build pipeline. To do this either talk to the instructor or create a demo project into the newly created organization with billing enabled, using [Azure DevOps Demo Generator](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net).
