## Score required to pass a Microsoft certification exam

All technical exam scores are reported on a scale of 1 to 1,000 and are scaled such that the passing score is 700. Any score of 700 or greater is a "pass." Any score below 700 is a "fail." The actual number of items you need to answer correctly to pass is determined by a group of subject matter experts in conjunction with the Microsoft psychometrician during the development and maintenance of the exam. The passing score is based on the knowledge and skills needed to demonstrate competence in the skill domain and the difficulty of the questions that a candidate answers when taking the exam.

For more informations about the exam scoring and score reports is available [**here**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exam-scoring-reports)

## Microsoft certification exam experience

You can demo the exam experience by visiting the exam sandbox at **[https://aka.ms/examdemo](https://aka.ms/examdemo)**.

<br/>

In the sandbox, you will be able to interact with the different question types (e.g., build list, drag and drop, etc.) that are available in the actual user interface that you will navigate during the exam. In addition, this experience includes the same introductory screens, instructions, and question type help information that you will see on your exam as well as the non-disclosure agreement that you must agree to before launching the exam.

As a result, using this sandbox should better prepare you for the exam experience and increase your familiarity with the user interface, how to navigate between pages and questions, what actions are required to answer each of the different question types, where information about the exam is located (e.g., time remaining, questions remaining, etc.), how to mark questions for review, and how to leave comments.
