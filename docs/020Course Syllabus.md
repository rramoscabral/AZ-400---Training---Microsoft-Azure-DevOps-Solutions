## Official course documentation

Microsoft Official Courses (MOCs) started with paper manuals and later underwent digital transformation in which the manuals began to be on a web platform managed by Arvato called **Skillpipe**.

From July 1, 2023, Skillpipe is no longer the official home for MOCs and **Microsoft Learn** will be the exclusive source of Microsoft training materials for students.

Now all active Microsoft course materials are exclusively available on Microsoft Learn.


**So that you always have access to the most up-to-date Course Syllabus possible and with quick access, I provide links to Microsoft Learn documentation according to the sequence of slides presented.**



## FAQ

- Can Learners download the course materials as a PDF?
    * The only download functionality at this point is what the web browser provides.


- Would we need to pay for licenses for course material on Microsoft Learn?
    * Microsoft Learn learner content is completely free. Learners will no longer receive licenses to the student course material.
    * Labs and exams are still charged items, as they still have a fee associated through Lab Hosters, and the exams themselves.
